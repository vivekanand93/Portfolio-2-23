      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <p>
        We ensure that all our web development and mobile application
        development projects are not only engineered using the most cutting edge
        technologies, but also they're created through a human-centred design
        process.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Personalized, in-depth technical guidance on a global scale that helps
        organizations achieve their digital transformation goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Successful product development requires a balanced approach. We blend
        personalized, in-depth technical guidance with our global scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        By leveraging Agile development methodologies, human-centered design
        tools, and best practices around security and risk management, we help
        organizations meet their needs reliably and efficiently.
      </p>

      <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
      <p>
        For every screen we design and build, the person interacting with that
        screen is top of mind. What are their needs? More importantly, what are
        the behaviors motivating those needs? By taking a human-centered design
        approach, we’re able to better meet and anticipate people’s expectations
        as they interact with your business and products. To achieve this, we
        conduct thorough foundational research before we even begin to think
        about the product’s design. This allows us to really understand the
        people you’re trying to reach and how to successfully engage them with
        your product or service. From there, we use our findings to guide how we
        design in a way that solves the problem and meets people’s needs in the
        simplest way possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Agile Software Development</h3>
      <p>
        Agile software development allows teams to deliver quickly, collaborate
        often, and continually improve their product. We take a slightly
        modified approach to the Agile methodology that maximizes those benefits
        while utilizing a global development model. Our global technical teams
        are 100% fluent in English and have adapted their workday to overlap
        with the working hours of our clients in the U.S. This makes
        communication a breeze and allows for four hours of collaborative time
        with our U.S.-based account managers, solutions architects, project
        managers, and designers. We conduct daily standups via Google Hangouts
        that keep everyone working together and on the same page — even if
        they’re not in the same office, city, or even country.
      </p>

      <h3>Secure Delivery</h3>
      <p>
        Effective security and privacy protocols are critical to every step of
        the development process — from single, standalone applications to
        complex cloud infrastructure. They should strike a balance between
        protecting data and information while creating a seamless process for
        users that imposes as little friction as possible. With our SOC 2 Type
        II certification, we leverage our heightened internal security controls
        to further support our clients’ more sensitive needs. By utilizing tools
        like role-based access control with single sign-on, we ensure that
        people have access to what they need in an efficient manner. We control
        access to source code in a very similar way. Additionally, our support
        teams can monitor your system post-launch, keeping an eye on any
        suspicious patterns. Should we detect any odd activity, we offer
        guidance on the next steps to minimize any potential damage.
      </p>

      <h3>Risk Management</h3>
      <p>
        Identifying potential risks at the start of and during any software
        project is critical in the success of your product. Risks can come from
        all over the place — from budget and cost, schedule, technology, and
        people to name a few. Our risk management team has experience
        identifying and dealing with all of those as well as ensuring continuity
        should an unforeseen issue pop up in the middle of a project. Whether
        we’re facing a challenge for the first time or the hundredth time, our
        team proposes, validates, and implements solutions that make the most
        sense for the project. Additionally, we keep a watchful eye on our
        capacity planning. With so many projects in flight at once, it’s crucial
        that we make sure we have the right people with the right skill sets
        available to meet our clients’ needs now and in the future.
